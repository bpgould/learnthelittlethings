# Utilites

- write github action to now all push if markdown not tagged with "publish": "yes"
- write simple Node filesystem pogram that can generate template markdown file with headers such as "publish": "no", similar to Hugo
- write build script that can re-alphebetize directories recursively and add all of these utilities as micro-blogs
